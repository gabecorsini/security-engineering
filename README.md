# Microsoft Security Engineering Repository

This repository is dedicated to my work as a Cloud Security Engineer, with a focus on Microsoft security technologies such as Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft XDR, and Kusto Query Language (KQL). The goal is to centralize queries, configurations, playbooks, and other resources for both personal reference and to share with the wider security community.

## Repository Structure

## Purpose

- Serve as a knowledge base and toolkit for Microsoft SIEM and XDR technologies
